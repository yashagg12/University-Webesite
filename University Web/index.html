      UEA is in such a lovely area and the campus is absolutely beautiful. It has pretty much everything you could need on campus, and has good transport links for buses and coaches, and it's one bus ride away from Norwich train station. I haven't had much experience with the student support services but I've heard from friends that they're pretty good. The uni was pretty good with COVID precautions, with vaccinations being available on campus as well as free testing. At times it's apparent that it is a company and it could do with remembering that its main priority should be its students and staff over making money for the VC, but overall I'm happy here and I wouldn't change my decision.

      I've enjoyed the course so far. I love seeing lecturers who are really enthusiastic about their subject, even when it seems niche to the rest of us. Moving to in person lectures has been done well this year, as generally every lecture is delivered in person as well as streamed online and recorded so 10/10 for that. I would say that sometimes the lectures and seminars (not including stats) seem a bit irrelevant to the summatives, so perhaps something could be rejigged in that department.

      First of all, Norwich is absolutely beautiful. It's a city with a towny feel and I felt at home as soon as I got here. The move away from Oyster cards at home was a bit weird at first (honestly still is) but I soon figured out what to say to the bus drivers. Transport links are pretty good, getting around by bus is easy enough, if a bit more expensive than I expected. Uber doesn't exist here so nights out are generally synonymous with getting a taxi, but there are usually enough available that it's no real issue. Train links seem pretty good and both Megabus and National Express stop on campus. There's also a hospital right next to the uni if you have any serious drunken mishaps, and a medical centre on campus if it's less serious.

      <h2>Utkarsh Kalra</h2><br>
      Living on campus was a pretty good experience for me. I lived there from Sep 2020-July 2021, so we suffered severely from COVID. I lived in Norfolk terrace ziggs. The double rooms weren't allowed due to COVID so I was living with 11 other people. Between us there was three toilets and two showers, one oven, two half fridges and three half freezers. Location-wise ziggs is really the best you can get, there's really no bad views onto the field and lake. At the end of the day I think it's the second cheapest accommodation available but it's really not bad value. Sharing toilets and showers isn't as big of a deal as you think it will be. Sharing a kitchen is the thing I didn't enjoy, particularly because my flatmates had a tendency for being extremely messy, but ours was the messiest flat I saw the entire year so I guess it's just who you get put with. I had a flatmate of mine move flats for a different issue and it was a really quick and easy process so if you do have any issues, it'll get sorted. Would recommend.

      <h2>Chirag Jindal</h2><br>
      Cardiff is an amazing city to study in. It's fairly cheap and extremely accessible by foot in the city centre. However, studying at Cardiff University has been a huge eye-opener for me; the staff and institution do not care about the well-being or safety of their students. This year my tution fees have covered various strikes, online university, lazy pre-recorded lectures AND an awful graduation ceremony where I and my fellow graduate will not recieve indivdual recognition. I will not get reimbursed for this. I would not reccommend this university to anyone.
